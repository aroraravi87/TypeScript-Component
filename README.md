# TypeScript-Demo

<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code.</p>

<p>JavaScript is standardized through the ECMAScript standards. Not all browsers in use support all features of newer ECMAScript standards (see this table). TypeScript supports new ECMAScript standards and compiles them to (older) ECMAScript targets</p>

JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means JavaScript does not know what type a variable is until it is actually instantiated at run-time. TypeScript adds type

<p>
TypeScript makes typing a bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference. For example: var x = "hello" in TypeScript is the same as var x : string = "hello". The type is simply inferred from its use. Even it you don't explicitly type the types.TypeScript types are also optional by default. If you leave the type out you will be able to code the way you were used to in JavaScript: dynamically.
